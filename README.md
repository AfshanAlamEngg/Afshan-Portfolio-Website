# Afshan's Portfolio Selector

Welcome to my **Portfolio Selector**! This simple web application serves as the root page, allowing users to choose which version of my portfolio they want to explore.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main files:
1. **HTML (`index.html`)**: Contains the structure of the root page.
2. **CSS (`styles.css`)**: Adds styling to the page for better visuals and user experience.
3. **JavaScript (`scripts.js`)**: Adds optional interactivity and functionality.

## Features

- A clean and simple design with user-friendly navigation links.
- Separate versions of your portfolio websites.
- Easy to expand and customize.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the respective portfolio versions in their designated folders (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`, etc.).
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the portfolio selector page.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for improving the project:
- Add animations or transitions to make the page more dynamic.
